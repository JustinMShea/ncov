\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In December 2019 an outbreak of novel, SARS-like coronavirus was
detected in Wuhan, China. In the intervening few weeks, case counts have
grown substantially. As of this writing, there are over 800 confirmed
cases and at least 25 deaths of what is currently named 2019-nCoV. It is
now understood that the virus is likely capable of person to person
spread, with a preliminary
\href{https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-01-2020-statement-on-t}{R0
estimate} of 1.2 - 2.5.

Although no sustained human to human transmission has been observed
outside of China, the possibility of unrecognized spread in other
countries cannot be ruled out at this stage. As an early effort to
explore this scenario in the United States, we compare the proportion of
weighted influenza like illness (wILI) that tests negative for influenza
for the 2019-2020 flu season to trends from previous seasons.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

We downloaded publicly available ILINet and WHO-NREVSS data for the
national level and HHS Region 10. HHS Region 10 is located in the
northwest of the US, where ILI has shown abnormally high levels this
season. Region 10 also contains Washington state, where the first case
of nCoV was detected in the US.

From the ILINet dataset, we downloaded weighted influenza-like illness
(wILI), which measures the percentage of doctor's office visits at
sentinel providers that had the primary complaint of fever plus an
additional influenza-like symptom (cough, sore throat, etc..). For the
WHO-NREVSS data, we obtained the total number of specimens tested by
participating clinical laboratories, as well as the percent of those
specimens that tested positive for influenza. These data have been
aggregated into a single reporting system since the 2015/2016 season, so
we use data since that time. Both data sources are available at the
weekly time-scale, defined as using the MMWR week standard used by the
CDC.

As a first approximation to compute a metric of similarity between the
two metrics, we chose to divide the percent positivity from NREVSS by
the wILI. The resulting ratio should be smaller when wILI values are
high relative to the percent positivity of clinical tests. Therefore,
low values of this metric would indicate that there is lower percent
positivity than \texttt{expected} given the current levels of wILI.

We note that a limitation of this metric is that wILI values can be
quite small, which could lead to unstable estimates, since this number
is in the denominator.

The code used to produce this report is available on GitHub at

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

We plot three panels for each region considered (national level and HHS
Region 10). We do not detect strong signal of anomalous patterns between
ILI rates and percent positivity with lab data. At the National level
the current season looks similar to past seasons (Figure
\ref{fig:national-plot}). In recent weeks in region 10, the ratio
defined above is smaller than it has been in the past 5 years, although
qualitatively it does not appear to be substantially lower than previous
years (Figure \ref{fig:region10-plot}).

\paragraph{Influenza-like illness not attributable to
influenza}\label{influenza-like-illness-not-attributable-to-influenza}}

Another measure of influenza illness not attributable to influenza can
be calculated as follows:

\[\text{ILI-} = (\text{proportion of tests positive for influenza}) \times \text{wILI}\]

It is important to note that reported wILI can vary substantially due to
differences in the types of health care providers reporting into ILInet:
some increases in reported wILI from one season to another may be driven
in part by changes in provider type make up. An approximate way to
adjust for this is by dividing reported wILI by the baseline for a given
region and season. This results in the following calculation of a
\textbf{r}elative ILI-.

\[\text{rILI-} = (\text{proportion of tests positive for influenza}) \times \frac{\text{wILI}}{\text{baseline level for ILI}}\]
